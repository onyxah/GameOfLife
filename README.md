# Conway's Game of Life

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Conway.
The game is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, with no further input.
One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.
